# ECCO-Insitu Processing Pipeline
Sweet Zhang 5/21/2023

The **NCEI.py** is a python script that is designed to process a NETCDF file that contains WOD data. There are 10 steps included in the pipeline that run various data verification tests to ensure data quality. Please reference this google drive for example output/ input files, and needed binary files, the link is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17h0qMS7vVimet8FXieGP1mWhnqnY0ljr?usp=sharing).

## Preprocessing: csv_to_nc.py
This script creates a set of NETCDF files from a '.csv' file containing WOD data. This script does some preliminary error checks of the following fields: 
- prof_flag: origin flag verification to make sure data is accurate
  - Origin flag information link [here](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/CODES/s_96_origflagset.html)
- datetime: makes sure date and time is valid
- longitude: value must be between - 180/180 and have valid units of 'decimal degrees'
- latitude: value must be between -90/90 and have valid units of 'decimal degrees'
- depth column: data must exist and have valid units of 'm'
- temperature column: data must exist and have valid units of 'degrees C'
- salinity column: if salinity data exists, must have valid units of 'PSS'

Any profiles failing the aforementioned tests will be excluded from the final NETCDF file. A log file will be generated containing a description of the failed test and the line number at which it occured in the '.csv' file.

### Running the script
FLAG          | DESCRIPTION
------------- | -------------
-i            | Path of directory where input NETCDF files are stored
-d            | Path of directory where output NETCDF and log files will be stored

Output files: 
- Log file: log_[filename]_[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM].txt
- NETCDF files: [filename]_[year].csv

### Example Data
Please see the **preprocessing_examples** folder inside the linked google drive for examples of data input and output.
- Input file: ocldb1525460187.4974.CTD.csv 
- Output files: all '.nc' files in folder, a '.txt' log file

## NCEI.py
This script creates a set of NETCDF files containing processed data. The steps of the data verification process are outlined below.
1. **update_prof_and_tile_points_on_profiles(MITprofs, grid_dir, llcN, wet_or_all)**
   - Updates profile_flattened_monotonic_grid_indicess and tile interpolation points so that the MITgcm knows which grid points to use for the cost 
2. **update_spatial_bin_index_on_prepared_profiles(sphere_bin, MITprofs, grid_dir)**
   - Updates each profile with a bin index that is specified from some file.
3. **update_monthly_mean_TS_clim_WOA13v2_on_prepared_profiles(clim_dir, MITprofs)**
   - Assigns the WOA13 T and S climatology values to MITprof objects. 
4. **update_sigmaTS_on_prepared_profiles(MITprofs, grid_dir, CTD_TS_bin, respect_existing_zero_weights, new_S_floor, new_T_floor)**
   - Update MITprof objects with new T and S uncertainity fields
5. **update_gamma_factor_on_prepared_profiles(MITprofs, grid_dir, apply_gamma_factor, llcN)**
   - Updates the MITprof profiles with a new sigma based on whether we are applying or removing the 'gamma' factor
6. **update_prof_insitu_T_to_potential_T(MITprofs, replace_missing_S_with_clim_S)**
    - Updates profile in-situ temperatures so that they are potential temperatures
7. **update_zero_weight_points_on_prepared_profiles('adjust', MITprofs)**
    - Zeros out profile profTweight and profSweight on points matching some criteria 
8. **update_remove_zero_T_S_weighted_profiles_from_MITprof(MITprofs)**
    - Remove profiles whose T and S weights are all zero from MITprof structures
9. **update_remove_extraneous_depth_levels(MITprofs)**
    - Remove profiles that whose T and S weights are all zero from from MITprof structures
10. **update_decimate_profiles_subdaily_to_once_daily(MITprofs, distance_tolerance, closest_time, method)**
    - Decimates profiles with subdaily sampling at the same location to once-daily sampling

### Running the script
Before running the script, there are some input parameters to adjust within the function **NCEI_pipeline** located in the **NCEI.py** file. Between lines 25-65, the following paths will need to be set:
- grid_dir
  - Path to grid_llc90 or grid_llc270 folder
- sphere_bin
  - Path to sphere_point_distribution folder containing files llc090_sphere_point_n_10242_ids.bin and llc090_sphere_point_n_02562_ids.bin
- clim_dir
  - Path to TS_climatology folder containing file WOA13_v2_TS_clim_merged_with_potential_T.nc
- CTD_TS_bin
  - Path to CTD_sigma_TS folder containing files Salt_sigma_smoothed_method_02_masked_merged_capped_extrapolated.bin and Theta_sigma_smoothed_method_02_masked_merged_capped_extrapolated.bin

These files can be downloaded in the **Dependents** folder inside of the linked google drive. In addition to these paths, various input parameters can be adjusted depending on user specifications.
Step 1:
  - **llcN**: this number should correspond to grid_dir (90 or 270)
  - **wet_or_all**: 0 = interpolated to nearest wet point, 1 = interpolated all points, regardless of wet or dry
    
Step 4: 
  - **respect_existing_zero_weights**: 0 = no, 1 = yes
  - **new_S_floor**: set this to zero if S_floor is unused 
  - **new_T_floor**: set this to zero if T_floor is unused

Step 5:
  - **apply_gamma_factor**: 0 = remove gamma factor from sigma, 1 = apply gamma to sigma. Gamma factor is factor 1/sqrt(alpha), where alpha = area/max(area) of the grid cell area in which this profile is found.

Step 6:
  - **replace_missing_S_with_clim_S**: 1 = replace, 0 = do not replace

Step 7:
  - Various parameters inside 'if' block pertaining to 'adjust' on lines 142 - 161 within script

Step 10:
  - **distance_tolerance**: radius within which profiles are considered to be at the same location in meters
  - **closest_time**: HHMMSS: if there is more than one profile per day in a location, choose the one that is closest in time to 'closest time' default is noon 
  - **method**: located within step10, choose method 0 or 1

Right below these steps located on lines 69-70, adjust parameters **steps_to_run** and **steps_to_save** if there is need to step any step or save any intermediate files. 

Output files: 
- NETCDF files: [filename]_[step]_[number]_[DATA_FLAG]_[year].nc
Example: if input NETCDF name is **ocldb1525460187.4974.CTD_1995.nc**, output filename will be **ocldb15254601874974_step_10_CTD_1995.nc**

### Example Data
Please see the **processed_ex** folder for examples of data output inside of the google drive. 

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Clean up unpopulated fields in NETCDF files
- [ ] Memory allocation issue (step 4), figure out a more efficent way of computing interpolations
